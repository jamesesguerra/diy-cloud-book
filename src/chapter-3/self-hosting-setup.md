# Choosing Your Self-Hosting Setup

When it comes to self-hosting, your choice of hardware or environment will shape your overall experience. Some prefer the hands-on flexibility of a dedicated mini PC at home, while others lean toward the convenience and scalability of virtual machines in the cloud. Each option has its own strengths and trade-offs. Mini PCs offer control and long-term savings, while VMs give you flexibility without upfront costs. This chapter explores both paths so you can choose the setup that fits your budget, goals, and comfort level.

The big advantage of both?
- You get to host as much as you want (as long as your PC’s CPU and memory aren’t completely maxed out). Hosting 1 database server would cost the same amount as hosting 10 database servers.
- You pay about the same, cheap price either way. Sure, a mini PC running at full tilt will draw a bit more electricity, but you get the point.
